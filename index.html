        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Rock Paper Scissors - Personal</h3>
        <p>Developed a Java implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" as a personal project.
            Utilized object-oriented programming principles to design classes for the game components such as
            players, moves, and the game engine. Currently implementing game logic to handle player inputs, determine
            winners, track scores, power-ups, and much more. Employed control structures and conditional statements
            for flow control and decision-making within the game. Utilized Java standard libraries for user input/output
            handling. Demonstrated proficiency in Java programming language and problem-solving skills through the
            successful completion of the project.
            </p>

        <h3>GPA Calculator - Personal</h3>
        <p>Developing a GPA (Grade Point Average) Calculator code using Java, providing a user-friendly interface for
            students to calculate their GPA based on inputted grades. The application allows users to input their course
            names, credits, and grades for each course, and then calculates the overall GPA based on the provided
            information. Implemented various features such as error handling to ensure valid inputs, graphical user
            interface (GUI) components for an intuitive user experience, and functionality to save and load previous
            calculations. Utilized object-oriented programming principles to design modular and maintainable code,
            enhancing the scalability and extensibility of the application.</p>
